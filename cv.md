### About me

I studied to be a lawyer, I didn't like it. I have been working with computers all 
my life (repair, modernization, installation of programs). My dream has always been to 
learn programming, but I thought it wasn't mine. Now I have set myself a goal to fix 
this and learn web programming. I am gradually moving towards this goal.
