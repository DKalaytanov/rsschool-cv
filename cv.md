###About me


    I studied to be a lawyer, I didn't like it. I have been working with computers all 
    my life (repair, modernization, installation of programs). My dream has always been to 
    learn programming, but I thought it wasn't mine. Now I have set myself a goal to fix 
    this and learn web programming. I am gradually moving towards this goal.
